# Yearly Employment/Living Wage/Distance to airport

## Data Cleaning Assessment
1. Cleaning needs: I first downloaded the BLS salary data. It was in week format, so I did the math by hand to change it to a yearly salary. Once I had stripped it down, I added the living wage data and the distance to airport. Both of these were hand created. 
2. Hand edits: Added Living Wage/Distance to airport. DIstance to the airport was discovered using Google Maps. I calculated the distance from each county seat to St. Louis airport. The living wage information was found on the MIT Living wage calculator. 
3. Program: Jupyter.
4. Time Spent: 2-3 hours.
