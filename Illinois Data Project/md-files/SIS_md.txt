1. Cleaning needs: This survey is incredibly expansive. I sliced out only the columns that I needed. I then derived the median of each column by county.
2. Hand edits: This required no hand edits.
3. Program: I cleaned my data inside of a Jupyter Notebooks. 
4. Time Spent: Around 2 hours. 

## Authorship/Attribution/Provenance 
This survey was created by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 
"The Institute’s annual Southern Illinois Poll collects voter opinion in the southernmost 18 counties in Illinois. It covers a wide range of policy topics important to residents of the region, including infrastructure, the economy, education, and the environment. The Southern Illinois Poll typically surveys 400 registered voters across the region. These surveys are based on a sample of telephone subscribers living in the 18 southernmost counties in Illinois, all south of Interstate 64. The respondents are located through random digit dialing techniques, which included both land lines and cell phones in the sample frame. The survey was contracted to Customer Research International of San Marcos, Texas, which did the sampling and the interviews following specifications provided by the staff of the Simon Institute."
