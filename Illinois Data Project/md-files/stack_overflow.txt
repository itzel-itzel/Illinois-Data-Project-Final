## Semantic Contents
This pretty much just includes the not-very-localized estimated salary for each county, which is 64,000 every time. 

## Collection Process
I used the calculator on the Stack Overflow Website for this instead of scraping it or downloading it. I calculated the salary for each county as a backend developer with one year of experience.

## Describe
column: county
includes 18 counties 

column: salary
includes numerical data representing the estimated salary of a developer.
